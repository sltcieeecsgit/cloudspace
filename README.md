## About Cloudpace

**Cloudpace** is a student-driven cloud technology event designed to introduce and empower undergraduates with practical knowledge in **cloud computing, AWS services, and modern cloud-based solutions**. The event focuses on bridging the gap between academic learning and real-world cloud engineering skills.

Organized with a strong emphasis on **hands-on learning**, Cloudpace highlights topics such as cloud fundamentals, deployment models, DevOps concepts, and real-world use cases. The initiative is inspired by practical learning platforms like **AWS Skill Builder**, where free cloud courses help students begin their cloud journey.

The event is coordinated by a **Cloud Computing undergraduate** with experience in:

* AWS foundational learning through Skill Builder
* Web and UI/UX development
* AI and machine learning projects (including plant disease detection systems)
* Event coordination and technical project management at university level

Cloudpace aims to create a collaborative environment where students can **learn, connect, and grow** in the cloud ecosystem—preparing them for certifications, internships, and future careers in cloud engineering.
